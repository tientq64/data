NEVER say this to a programmer:

Hey! Your code has bugs!

He or she will immediately respond:

No! You must have pressed wrong buttons!

INSTEAD you should say this:

Hey! Your code cannot satisfy the requirements!

Then the response will be:

What??? There must be a bug! I will fix it!
